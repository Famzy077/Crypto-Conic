CryptoCronic is a modern, full-stack web application designed to help cryptocurrency enthusiasts track their investments, view real-time market data, and stay updated with the latest news in the crypto space.

This application features a public-facing section for general market data and a private, secure dashboard for personalized portfolio management.



‚ú® Features
Real-Time Market Data: View a live-updating list of the top cryptocurrencies, including price, market cap, and 24h change, powered by the CoinCap API.

Detailed Coin View: Click on any cryptocurrency to see more detailed information and historical data.

Crypto News Feed: A dedicated page displaying the latest news from the world of cryptocurrency.

Secure User Authentication: Users can register and log in using a traditional email/password system or through a secure Google OAuth 2.0 flow. Authentication is handled with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

#Personalized Portfolio Management:

Authenticated users can add their crypto holdings (e.g., "I own 0.5 BTC at a buy price of $30,000").

The dashboard automatically calculates the current value of each holding and the total portfolio value.
